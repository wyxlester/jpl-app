# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# 2.times do |i|
#   users = User.new(email: Faker::Internet.email, password: "password", username: Faker::Internet.username)
#   users.save
#   2.times do
#     listing = Listing.new(item_name: Faker::Commerce.product_name, item_description: Faker::Commerce.material, price: 30)
#     listing.user = users
#     listing.save
#     puts "Created listing"
#   end
#   puts "Generated #{i + 1} users"
# end
